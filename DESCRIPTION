Version: 0.0.7
Date: 2014-10-31
Author: Thomas Lin Pedersen
Maintainer: Thomas Lin Pedersen <thomasp85@gmail.com>
Description: This package facilitates working with LC-MS(/MS) data in R. It is
    written mainly for proteomic data, but can equally well be used for other
    fields. It shares a similar scope as xcms, but defines a more flexible
    class structure, that makes it easy to navigate between raw and derived
    data.
