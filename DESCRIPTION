Description: 
    This package facilitates working with LC-MS(/MS) data in R. It is written
    mainly for proteomic data, but can equally well be used for other fields. It
    shares a similar scope as xcms, but defines a more flexible class structure,
    that makes it easy to navigate between raw and derived data.
