Version 0.0.8
________________________________________________________________________________
* Handling of raw vs. modified data. All raw extraction methods now have a raw
  parameter to choose whether to extract directly from mzR connection. The 
  nature (raw vs unraw) is saved in the MsList object and passed on to 
  derivatives.
* Added isRaw to test whether elements are from raw data
* Added uNames to create truly unique names even with duplicate elements
* Added memberIndex and raw to the mapping matrix in MsList. raw saves the 
  rawness of the elements, memberIndex is in preparation to include MsDataSet as
  connections instead of only MsData.
