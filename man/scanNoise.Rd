\title{Get intensity threshold for a given signal-to-noise ratio}
\usage{
scanNoise(scan, sn, rho)
}
\arguments{
\item{scan}{A matrix with mz and intensity values}

\item{sn}{The required minimum signal-to-noise to be considered a real
signal}

\item{rho}{The modifier to use for the second lowest ion special case}
}
\value{
A numeric with the intensity of the first ion that gets accepted as
a true signal
}
\description{
This function takes a scan and finds the first non-noise ion in it based on
the dynamic noise level algorithm described by Xu and Freitas (2009). It
returns the intensity of that ion.
